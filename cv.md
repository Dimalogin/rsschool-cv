### Briefly About Myself:

Over the years of college and subsequent work in the specialty, I realized that I had lost interest in the specialty and began to develop in the field of website development and web applications.
  
I have been dealing with this issue for more than six months. I have experience in developing several non-commercial sites.

After studying technology, I plan to create web applications that solve problems for people around the world.
