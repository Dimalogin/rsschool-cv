### Briefly About Myself:

Over the years of college and subsequent work in the specialty, I realized that I had lost interest in the specialty and began to develop in the field of website development and web applications.
  
I have been dealing with this issue for more than six months. I have experience in developing several non-commercial sites.

After studying technology, I plan to create web applications that solve problems for people around the world.

### Code example:

**Subarray with the highest sum, from learm.javascript.ru** 

Given: array of numbers,  example: `arr = [1, -2, 3, 4, -9, 6]`

Find a contiguous subarray in an arr, with the maximum sum of elements.

```
function getMaxSum(arr) {

    let maxSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

        let sum = 0;

        for (let j = i; j < arr.length; j++) {

            sum = sum + arr[j];

            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        };

    };

};

let arr = [1, -2, 3, 4, -9, 6];

getMaxSum(arr); \\\ 7
